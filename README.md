# Threads
This Python script demonstrates the usage of threading to efficiently fetch product data from a dummy JSON API. The script sends asynchronous HTTP GET requests to a series of URLs, extracts product data from the responses using the requests library, and appends the JSON data to 'data.json'. The use of threading enables concurrent handling of requests for improved performance.
